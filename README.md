# Data Curation and Analysis | Abhiyan Bhandari

Goal: For my data curation and analysis project I wanted to gather the list of the most populated cites in the United States and create vizuliations for the top 50 most populated cites. I created two graphs that gave me intutive summaries and understanding of the population growth and patterns in the country. 

Data Types: int = Population and Rank 
            String = Name and State

This approach simplifies the dataset and narrows my scope to the most populous cities, enabling exploration of trends, patterns, or comparisons related to these specific columns. By concentrating on these key attributes, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics and characteristics of the most populous cities, such as their growth prospects and their rankings relative to one another.

For the first visualization, I put 10 cities from the top 50 most populated cities on a graph measuring their growth rate according to their population. From the graph, we can see that the large city with the highest growth rate was Phoneix, followed by San Antonio, Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, and Las Vegas in the top five. These cities are experiencing significant population growth and we can look at more indepth characteristcs of what makes these places an attractive place to move to.

For the second vizulization I created a graph that displays the distribution of cities in the top 50 based on the number of cities from each U.S. state. Each bar on the graph represents a state, and its height corresponds to the number of cities from that state that are ranked in the top 50. From the graph, we can observe that a few states, such as California, Texas, and Florida, have a notable presence in the top 50 cities. This suggests that these states host multiple cities that are among the top 50 in terms of certain criteria, which could include factors like population, economic development, or quality of life.
